# Fitness companion

The fitness companion app will be used to establish and track personal fitness goals and progress  as well as choosing fitness and meal plans to follow. Tools for tracking and calculating various fitness related statistics will be provided to users and all collected statistics will be viewable in simple text or a more visual graph formats.

This system is designed to be used by anyone who exercises regularly and would like to track their goals and progress. It will feature tools such as a step counter to automatically track your steps as well as options to create your own goals to be tracked manually. The fitness companion will also have options to track and calculate your calories. A BMI (body mass index) calculator will also be built into the app for people to easily calculate their current BMI and track how their BMI changes over time. The option to manually track your sleep will also be available to users.

The fitness companion will also offer features to accommodate people that are new to exercising and dieting. As well as a number of beginner friendly exercise programs to choose from, the app will also have a section for meal plans that are easy to follow and have various nutritional information such as calories and macro nutrient compositions listed.

This system is envisioned as an android application but could be easily expanded to ios. A web companion for more detailed statistical analysis and various other features such as leaderboards would also be possible in the future. Friendly competitions are also an envisioned feature that could be added to the fitness companion in the future. Users would be able to add their friends to a list and invite them to competitions. This would allow users to compete against their friends in order to be the first to reach or get as close as possible to a specific goal within a given time frame.

This system greatly improves on traditional fitness tracking done with pen and paper, but also improves on other fitness apps by bringing together features that are often separated into multiple apps. Being able to track your progress, browse through and pick exercise and meal plans all through one app is much more efficient than having to download multiple apps and switch between them for specific features. 

The success of the fitness companion will be based on ratings from the google play store. An overall rating above 3.5 stars will be considered a success. We will also judge the success of the application on user surveys. We will consider the app a success if at least 75 percent of users prefer our app over fitness apps shipped with the phone or with apps that the user was previously using for tracking their fitness and health.
