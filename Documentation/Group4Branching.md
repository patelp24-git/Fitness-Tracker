# Group 4 Branching Stratagy
Our group has decided to go with the *GitHub Flow* branching stratagy for the development of the Fitness Companion application. *GitHub Flow* folows these steps:

1. The main branch must be deployable and functional
2. Any new features or user stories will be created in a branch off of master that is descriptivly named
3. Work will be committed locally and frequently pushed to the branch on the gitlab server
4. A pull request will be opened once the branch is ready to merge or assistance is needed 
5. Once the pull request has been reviewed by at least one other group member, the branch can be merged into the master branch
6. The master branch is then deployed
